Adding New Content Pack Documentation: 
1. Open an issue to create a new feature branch titled with the change being made/content being added. This should be done from the branch into which the change must be added and NOT from the master branch. 
   1. For example, if a new content pack is being added for a future release, like 5.1, the feature branch should be created from the 5.1 branch. 
2. Copy and duplicate the New Content Pack Template file, adjusting it with the correct name for the content pack you are introducing. Save it under Content > Content Packs.
3. Fill in all required fields and add headings, text, and images as required. 
   1. Please save all images under the Content > Resources > Images folder in a separate folder title with the same name as your content pack. 
4. (If it becomes difficult to adjust or add information in a table or if there are any other difficulties in adding content, contact Annie to add the content manually in Flare once the pull request has been created.)
5. Once the content has been added/updated successfully, create a pull request and add Annie as the reviewer. 
6. Annie will then review the content in Flare and make any changes necessary, pushing the updated content back to the feature branch. 
7. Once the request has been approved, close and merge the PR and delete the feature branch. 


Updating Existing Documentation: 
1. Open an issue to create a new feature branch titled with the change being made/content being added. This should be done from the branch into which the change must be added and NOT from the master branch. 
2. Locate the existing file that requires updating or additional content added and modify as needed. 
3. (If it becomes difficult to adjust or add information in a table or if there are any other difficulties in adding content, contact Annie to add the content manually in Flare once the pull request has been created.)
4. Once the content has been added/updated successfully, create a pull request and add Annie as the reviewer. 
5. Annie will then review the content in Flare and make any changes necessary, pushing the updated content back to the feature branch. 
6. Once the request has been approved, close and merge the PR and delete the feature branch.
