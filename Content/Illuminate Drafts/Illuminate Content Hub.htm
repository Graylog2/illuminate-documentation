            <p>The Content Hub provides many content packs for you to choose from. Click any content pack in the list to view details about that pack. The description explains what logs or other enrichment the content pack provides. The detail pane also shows any dependencies, such as Graylog version requirements and other content packs that need to be enabled as well.</p>
            <p>To find specific content packs for your environment, you can enter keywords in the search field, and you can apply filters. The filters available are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Status</b>: Apply this filter to toggle between packs that are <i>Enabled</i> or <i>Disabled</i> in your environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>New</b>: Select <i>True</i> to show content packs that are new or include new content, or <i>False</i> to show only packs not tagged as new.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Type</b>: Use this filter to view either all <i>Processing</i> or all <i>Spotlight</i> content packs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Tags</b>: Select a tag from the list, which represents a <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/" target="_blank">MITRE tactic category</a>. You can also use the search field on the filter to enter a specific term or tactic number to see if there is matching Illuminate content.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are looking for a specific content pack, enter the title or keyword in the search box. You can also use search together with filters to better target your results.</p>

            <h2>Enable Content Packs</h2>
            <p>To enable content packs for your environment:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Locate the pack you want to install in the list, then select the check box on the left. The pack you selected is added to the <i>Selected Packs</i> sidebar on the right.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(Optional) Add additional packs if you plan to install multiple packs. Each pack is added to the list in <i>Selected Packs</i>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click <i>Install Packs</i>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that you have the correct packs, including their dependencies. The dialog box shows each pack you selected. If a pack has dependencies, you can expand that line to review the specific requirements. When the dependency is another content pack, you can select it here to add it to the installation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <section class="infoBox">
                            <div class="content"><b>Hint:</b> Illuminate allows you to install content packs without required dependencies. For instance, you can install a spotlight pack without enabling the requisite processing pack. However, that pack is not useful without its dependent pack. Therefore, it is recommended to install related packs together.</div>
                        </section>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click <i>Confirm</i> to begin installation. The screen shows the installation progress. When all packs are installed, the screen returns to the Content Hub.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Disable Packs</h3>
        <p>If you need to disable a content pack, the procedure is similar to enabling a pack. Follow these
steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Locate the pack you want to disable in the list, then select the check box on the left. The pack you selected is added to the <i>Selected Packs</i> sidebar on the right. Note that you can make use of the <i>Status</i> filter to show only packs that are enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) Add additional packs if you plan to disable multiple packs. Each pack is added to the list in <i>Selected Packs</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <i>Uninstall Packs</i>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that you have the correct packs. The dialog box shows each pack you selected. If a pack has another content pack as a dependency, you can choose to disable it as well. For instance, if you are disabling a processing pack, you should disable the related spotlight pack as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <em>Confirm</em> to uninstall the packs.
The screen shows progress steps during uninstallation. When all packs are disabled, the screen returns to the Content Hub.</li>
        </ol>
