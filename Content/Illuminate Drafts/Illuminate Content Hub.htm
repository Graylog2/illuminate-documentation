        <h1>Illuminate Content Hub</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The Illuminate Content Hub is where you find all available Illuminate content packs. This list includes both those you have enabled as well as those available to enable. When new or updated packs are released, they appear automatically at the top of this list.</p>
            <p>Find the Content Hub at <i>Enterprise &gt; Illuminate</i>.</p>
            <p>This topic guides you through how to find specific content packs and how to enable packs for your environment.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Graylog Enterprise or Security license with Illuminate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You must be a Graylog administrator to access Illuminate content.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>New Content Interval</h2>
            <p>When new Illuminate content packs are available, they are automatically included in the list of available packs. New content packs as well as updated content packs are shown with the <i>New</i> label and are sorted at the top of the list. By default, Graylog checks for new content every 12 hours.</p>
            <p>If you want to change this interval, you can update the <code class="linecode">illuminate_hub_new_version_check_interval</code> property in your <code class="linecode">server.conf</code> file. For information about how to update server.conf, see <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/setting_up_graylog/server.conf.html">Graylog Server Configuration</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Find Content Packs</h2>
            <p>The Content Hub provides many content packs for you to choose from. Click any content pack in the list to view the detail pane about that pack. The description explains what logs or other enrichment the content pack provides. The detail pane also shows any dependencies, such as Graylog version requirements and other content packs that need to be enabled as well.</p>
            <p>To find specific content packs for your environment, you can enter keywords in the search field, and you can apply filters. The filters available are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Status</b>: Apply this filter to toggle between packs that are <i>Enabled</i> or <i>Disabled</i> in your environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>New</b>: Select <i>True</i> to show content packs that are new or include new content, or <i>False</i> to show only packs not tagged as new.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Type</b>: Use this filter to view either all <i>Processing</i> or all <i>Spotlight</i> content packs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Tags</b>: Select a tag from the list, which represents a <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/" target="_blank">MITRE tactic category</a>. You can also use the search field on the filter to enter a specific term or tactic number to see if there is matching Illuminate content.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are looking for a specific content pack, enter the title or keyword in the search box. You can also use search together with filters to better target your results.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Enable Content Packs</h2>

        </div>
        <h3>Disable Packs</h3>
        <p>If you need to disable a content pack, the procedure is basically the same as for enabling a pack. Follow these

            <li>
                <p>Locate the pack you want to disable in the list, then select the check box on the left. The pack you selected is added to the <i>Selected Packs</i> sidebar on the right. Note that you can make use of the <i>Status</i> filter to show only packs that are enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(optional) Add additional packs if you plan to disable multiple packs. Each pack is added to the list in <i>Selected Packs</i>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click Uninstall Packs.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that you have the correct packs. The dialog box shows each pack you selected. If a pack has another content pack as a dependencies, you can choose to disable it as well. For instance, if you are disabling a processing pack, you should disable a related spotlight pack as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <em>Confirm</em> to uninstall the packs.
The screen shows progress steps during uninstallation. When all packs are disabled, the screen returns to the Content Hub.</li>
