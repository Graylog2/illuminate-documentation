        <p>Graylog supports out-of-the-box parsing for a wide variety of common log sources, so if your logs fall into one of the categories of log for which there is either a dedicated input, a dedicated Illuminate component, or that uses a defined Syslog format, it remains easy.</p>
        <p>Since there is no one-size-fits-all approach, this guide will instead just try to provide useful quick examples and links to the primary methods of parsing logs.</p>
        <p>We will assume in all the subsequent examples that the text that needs parsing is in the $message.message field. When lifting pipeline rules from this guide, remember to replace this field in the code block with the field from which you are trying to parse text.</p>
