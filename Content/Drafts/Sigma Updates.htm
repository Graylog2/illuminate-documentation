        <h1>Sigma Updates</h1>
        <h4>Download Sigma Rule Files</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With the release of Graylog 5.2, we have added a new capability that allows you to download Sigma rule files individually or in bulk. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">To download a single rule, simply click on the ellipsis next to the desired rule and choose the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Download</i> option. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Sigma Rules 5.2/Single Download.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to download multiple rules at once, select the rules you want to download and then click on the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Bulk Actions</i> button. From the drop-down menu, select the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Download</i><b> </b>option.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Sigma Rules 5.2/Bulk Download Sigma Rules.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you initiate the download, your browser will automatically begin the process. It is important to note that if you choose multiple files, they will be downloaded as a .zip file containing the rules YAML files.</p>
        <h4>Direct Import of Sigma Files</h4>
        <p>Along with being able to import Sigma rules from Git repositories, rules can now be imported directly from the file system. To open the upload window, select <i style="font-weight: bold;">Upload Rules</i><b> </b>from the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Add Rules</i><b> </b>drop-down. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Sigma Rules 5.2/Upload Rules.png" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In this window both individual Sigma YAML files as well as .zip files containing multiple YAML files can be selected. Each individual rule can have its streams, notifications, and search configuration modified by clicking on the corresponding file in the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Selected Files</i> list. A configuration can be applied to all rules using the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Use these settings on all rules button</i>. All rules uploaded in a .zip file will be given the same configuration.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Sigma Rules 5.2/Selected Files.png" />
        </p>
        <p>On confirmation, all individual rules that were successfully imported will be removed from the <i style="font-weight: bold;">Selected Files</i> list. Any rule that failed to import will remain in the list and a reason for the failure will be displayed. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Sigma Rules 5.2/Failed Import.png" />
            <br />The same process applies in the case of a ZIP file which has invalid rules that cannot be imported, all valid rules will be imported, the failures will be displayed, and the ZIP file will remain in the list.</p>
