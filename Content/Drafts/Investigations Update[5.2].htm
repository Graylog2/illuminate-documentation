        <h1>Investigations Updates[5.2]</h1>
        <h3 class="title">Enable Investigation assignment email notifications</h3>
        <p>In Graylog 5.2, we have introduced the email notifications for assigned investigations functionality. This functionality is enabled by default for existing installations. To enable this setting:</p>
        <p>From your Graylog user interface, click on the <i>Security</i> tab on the top navigation header and select <i>Investigations</i> from the left menu pane.</p>
        <p>On the Investigations page, click on the Config tab and toggle the <i>Enable Investigation assignment email notifications</i> capsule button.<br /></p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once enabled, email notifications will be sent to both the user and the assigned team(s) involved in the investigation. These notifications are triggered immediately upon assignment.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This functionality requires that the <code class="linecode">transport_email_</code> server configuration settings (<a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-1/setting_up_graylog/server.conf.html?Highlight=email">server.conf</a>) are properly configured to send email from Graylog. If those are not set, the email will not send.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Relative time searches to absolute time prompt</h3>
        <p>Prior to Graylog 5.2, users were unable to save relative time searches. In most cases, when users save searches as evidence, they prefer to use absolute time to ensure consistent log retrieval during subsequent investigations.  However, at search time a lot of these searches are relative (e.g.,show me everything from the last hour). Now, when a user tries to add a relative saved search as evidence to an investigation, the system prompts the user to either convert to absolute time, or keep the relative search as is. If the user opts to convert, the system would duplicate the saved search with the absolute time parameters instead, and name the search "Absolute Time". This functionality allows users to save relative time searches and eliminates the need to  manually change the time settings on their existing searches.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/Investigations/Save Search Prompt.png" style="width: 2227px;height: 1390px;" /></p>

        <h3 class="title">Auto create investigations for alerts</h3>
        <p>Previously, new investigations were manually  created. In 5.2 we have introduced a new alert notification type which when configured, automatically adds an alert to an investigation when an event is triggered.</p>
        <p>On the Event Definitions page, there is now a new notification method (<i>Create Investigation Notification</i>) that allows for creating an investigation automatically when an alert is triggered. Users have the option to create a new investigation every time the event fires, or to add each event as evidence to the same Investigation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>To create a new investigation every time an event fires, users need to select the check-box option while configuring the notification and this will automatically create a new investigation when the defined condition is met.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Support Markdown in Investigation notes</h3>
        <p>Investigation notes now have a custom markdown editor. The custom markdown editor significantly enhances the note-taking experience by allowing users to structure and format their notes using features such as headers, bullet points, tables, numbered lists, code snippets and hyperlinks, thereby enriching the content quality of the notes.</p>
        <p> Its preview feature enables users view the final output, ensuring that errors and discrepancies can be rectified before saving.</p>
