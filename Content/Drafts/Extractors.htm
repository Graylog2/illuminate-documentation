        <p>Extractors are a legacy feature of Graylog providing an interface for extracting fields from messages hitting an input using Regex. We recommend against creating your parsing rules using the extractors interface, as it is outdated; however, you can read more about extractors and how they work in the <a href="https://archivedocs.graylog.org/en/3.3/pages/extractors.html">legacy Graylog Documentation</a>.</p>
        <p>Extractors have been around for many years, so there is one merit to continuing to use this functionality: the Graylog Open community has created a lot of useful extractor parsing rules over the years, and these are all available to download from the Graylog Marketplace.</p>
        <p>If you require a parser for the complex logs of a common hardware device or software suite, it can be worth checking if the Graylog Open community has already produced them. Work smarter not harder: downloading someone else's ready-made parser is usually quicker than writing your own.</p>
        <p>Be mindful, however, that this option is presented late in this guide because it is something of a last resort. Extractors are a vestigial mechanism and are being community written and maintained. They carry no guarantee on being correct, up to date, or even working. There will usually be a bit of TLC required to get such content working and up to date.</p>
