        <p>Content packs are a convenient way to share configuration. A content pack is a JSON
 file which contains a set of configurations of Graylog components. This JSON file can be uploaded to Graylog
 instances and then installed. A user who takes the time to create an input, pipelines and a dashboard for a certain type
 of log format, can thus easily share their efforts with the community.</p>
        <p>Content packs can be found in
    <a href="https://marketplace.graylog.org/">Graylog Marketplace</a>.</p>

            <div class="title"><b>Warning:</b>&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">Content packs in 3.0 have changed fundamentally from previous versions<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2024-04-03T10:14:06.3335740-05:00" MadCap:creator="PhillipUmeh" MadCap:initials="PU" MadCap:comment="Any support info (EOL,EOS)?"

 support older versions in the future, but at this point there is no guarantee that older content packs still
 work.</MadCap:annotation></span></div>

        <h3>Parameter</h3>
        <p>Content packs can have parameters. These parameters help to adjust the configuration to
 the needs of the user. A good example usage is the port of an input. The creator of the content pack may have their
 input running on port 55055 but the user (of the content pack) may already have an input running on that specific
 port. The creator can specify a parameter and assign it to the port. The user of the content pack will be asked for
 a value of the parameter on installation. The provided value will then be used as the port of the input in the new
 system.</p>
        <h2>How Do I Create a Content Pack?</h2>

            <li>Navigate to <strong>System / Content Packs</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Create a Content Pack</strong> on the upper right side of the page. A new content pack is
 created in a wizard. On the left side of that page is the navigation of the wizard. There are 3 steps to content
 pack creation: <strong>Content Selection</strong>, <strong>Parameters</strong> and <strong>Preview</strong>. In
 the middle part of the page is the form of each wizard step. And on the right side is the summary of the content
 pack in creation.

        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Fill out the General Information section.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Content Selection</strong> offers configurations which can be included to the content pack.
 Necessary dependencies will be included automatically.
    </li>
        </ol>
        <section class="warningBox">
            <div class="title"><b>Warning:</b>&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">The one exception to this rule is dependencies for pipeline rules. Currently, grok patterns
 and lookup tables for pipeline rules must be added manually to the content pack. Support for automatic inclusion
 of pipeline rule dependencies will be added in a future release.</span></div>
        </section>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Click on <strong>Next</strong> or <strong>Parameter</strong> to go the Parameter Page. Parameters are
 placeholders which will be filled out during the installation of a content pack. They allow for parts of the
 configuration to be adjusted according to the user's needs. To create a parameter click on <strong>Create
 Parameter</strong>. The name, type and default value of the parameter can be specified in the modal that appears.
 Graylog supports four types of configuration values: String, Integer, Double and Boolean.

        <ol start="6">
            <li>The created parameter can be assigned to a configuration key by pressing <strong>Edit</strong> on one of the
 previously selected configurations under <strong>Entity List</strong>.
    </li>
            <li>The final step of creation can be reached by clicking on <strong>Next</strong> or&#160;<strong>Preview</strong>.
 The preview page displays a summary of the new content pack. This page is meant for a final close inspection
 of the content pack before creation.
    </li>
            <li>To finish the creation click on <strong>Create</strong> or <strong>Create and Download</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Upload a Content Pack</h2>
        <p>Content packs may be downloaded from <a href="https://marketplace.graylog.org/">Graylog Marketplace</a>. To upload these content packs navigate
 to <strong>System / Content Packs</strong> and click on <strong>Upload</strong>. The modal that appears has a file
 finder to select the downloaded content pack. Click on <strong>Upload</strong> to finish the process. The uploaded
 content pack may now be installed on the new Graylog system.</p>
        <h2>Installing a Content Pack</h2>
        <p>To install the
 newest version of a content pack, navigate to&#160;<strong>System / Content Packs</strong>. This page shows the list
 of uploaded and created content packs. By clicking <strong>Install</strong> on the desired content pack, a modal
 will open which will ask for a <strong>Install Comment</strong> and the values of the parameters. It also shows the
 list of configurations that will be installed on the system. Click on <strong>Install</strong> to complete the
 installation.</p>
        <section class="infoBox">
            <div class="title"><b>Hint</b>:&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">Some entities need a unique title or name (e.g. Lookup Table). When installing such an entity
 and the title is already present on the system, then Graylog will use the installed entity instead of installing
 a new one. Even when the new configuration differs from the already installed one.</span></div>
        </section>
        <h2>Uninstalling a Content Pack</h2>
        <p>Navigate to <strong>System / Content Packs</strong> and click on the
