# HAProxy Notes

HAProxy, is an open-source software solution that provides a high-performance and highly available TCP and HTTP load balancer and proxy server.

## About HAProxy Log Collection

HAProxy HTTP Server on a Linux system. This pack will parse out and configure HAProxy TCP, HTTP, HTTPS and TCP logs.

## Supported version(s)

Tested with Version 2.9.

## Stream Configuration

"Illuminate:HAProxy LoadBalancer Messages"

If this stream name is already defined, then nothing will be changed. If this stream name does not exist, then it will be created.

## Index Set Configuration

"HAProxy LoadBalancer Messages"

If this index set is already defined, then nothing will be changed. If this index set does not exist, it will be created with retention settings of a daily rotation and 90 days of retention. These settings can be adjusted as required after installation.

## Supported Log Formats

- Default/Connection Logs
- Error Logs
- TCP Logs (option tcplog)
- HTTP Logs (option httplog)
- HTTPS Logs (option httpslog)

## Log Format Examples

```text
Connection logs:
haproxy[1234]: Connect from 10.0.1.2:33312 to 10.0.3.31:8012 (www/HTTP)

Error Log:
haproxy[6103]: 127.0.0.1:56059 [03/Dec/2023:17:35:10.380] frt/f1: Connection error during SSL handshake

TCP log:
haproxy[14387]: 10.0.1.2:33313 [06/Feb/2023:12:12:51.443] graylog-in static/srv1 8/9/5007 212 PH -1/2/3/4/5 6/7

HTTP/HTTPS log:
haproxy[1234]: 10.0.1.2:33317 [06/Feb/2023:12:14:14.655] https-in static/srv1 11/0/31/68/108 200 2353 - - ---- 1/2/3/4/5 6/7 {graylog.de} {} "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 0/0/0/0/0 graylog.de/TLSv1.3/TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

Custom log formats are not supported.
```

## Requirements

The content pack supports logging via syslog.

The official setup guide for HAProxy and syslog is here:
<https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-logging>

Note:
Graylog needs a syslog input with the matching IP, port and protocol to receive the logs.

## What is Provided

Parsing rules to extract HAProxy logs into Graylog schema-compatible fields.

- HAProxy default logs get the GIM code "129999" (network.default)

- Logs with the http_request get the GIM code "180000" (http.message)

## Mappings

### Default log structure

The default format is deprecated, but the content pack will support it.
