        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <section class="infoBox">
            <div class="title"><b>Hint</b>:&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">The following instructions are valid only when upgrading from Illuminate 1.7.0. Any
 Illuminate versions prior to 1.7.0 must first be upgraded to Illuminate 1.7.0 prior to a final upgrade to
 Illuminate 2.0.0</span></div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>If you are not currently running any previous Illuminate versions, see

        <section class="warningBox">
            <div class="title"><b>Warning</b>:&#160;If you are upgrading to Illuminate 2.0.1 or later from Illuminate 1.x you must first upgrade
 to Illuminate 2.0.0 as instructed in this article. Then,
        <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/upgrading_to_illuminate_2.0.x.html#illuminate-201">proceed to the Illuminate
 2.0.1 section</a>.</div>
        </section>
        <p>Prior to upgrading, the following conditions must be met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment must be running Graylog
 Operations 4.2.0 or later.
    </li>
            <li>The Graylog cluster must have a current and valid Operations license.</li>
            <li>Verify that the content pack “Default Grok Patterns” is installed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Changes In This Release</h2>
        <p>A new installation method is now available so that Illuminate 2.0 can be
 installed entirely from the Graylog web interface.</p>
        <section class="infoBox">
            <div class="title"><b>Hint</b>:&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">This installer does not include the addition of Geolocation and Autonomous System Number
 (ASN) lookup mmdb files, which can be installed manually if the Geolocation and
 ASN lookup files were configured to work with previous versions of Illuminate.</span></div>
        </section>
        <p>Additionally, Illuminate metadata fields that previously used the field name prefix
    <code data-backticks="1" class="linecode">gl2_</code> have now been renamed to the prefix <code data-backticks="1" class="linecode">gim_</code>. This
 will improve support for using these fields in different parts of Graylog. Field aliases will allow searches that
 use the updated field names to access data previously indexed with the old field names.</p>
        <p>Field aliases will
 also be used to allow content organized by the old field names to search newly indexed data; however, the one
 exception to this rule is the field <code data-backticks="1" class="linecode">gim_event_subcategory</code>.</p>
        <h2>Upgrading from
 Illuminate 1.7.0</h2>
        <p>Follow the preceding steps in order to update your Illuminate instance to the latest
 version.</p>
        <h2>Review the Processor Order Configuration</h2>
        <p>Temporarily configuring the Illuminate processor to
 run prior to the Message Filter Chain and Pipeline Processor will ensure the upgrade of Illuminate is a more
 straightforward process.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to your Graylog application.</li>
            <li>Navigate to <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Configurations</em>.</li>
            <li>Review and make a note of the current order of the Message Processors Configuration. <strong>You will need this
 information to restore the listed order later!</strong></li>
            <li>Verify that the Illuminate Processor is ordered to run <strong>before</strong> the Pipeline Processor and
 Message Filter Chain. If this is not the case, select “Update” and move the Illuminate Processor as required.
    </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Illuminate Processing Management/config update.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Record Currently Enabled Content Packs</h2>
        <p>Next, you will want to record the current content packs enabled on
 your Graylog instance.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In Graylog, navigate to <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Content Packs</em>.</li>
            <li>Locate the filter entry text box; enter the word <code data-backticks="1" class="linecode">Illuminate</code> and click on <em>Filter</em>.
    </li>
            <li>Record a separate list of all Illuminate content packs that are listed as installed, but do not uninstall or
 delete these content packs.
    </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Illuminate Processing Management/filter.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Extract the Graylog Illuminate Release Archive File</h2>
        <p>Graylog Illuminate is distributed as a zip format
 archive file. <a href="https://go2.graylog.org/contact-sales">Contact your sales representative</a> for information
 on obtaining the Graylog Illuminate 2.0 release file.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once you receive the file, download and extract it in a convenient location.</li>
            <li>The archive will expand into a directory starting with the name “graylog_illuminate.” The Illuminate bundle zip
 file and the file “spotlights” will be located in this subdirectory, which contains all of the included
 Illuminate Spotlight content packs.
    </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Update the Event Definitions</h2>
        <p>Illuminate 2.0 includes some changes to field definitions that require
 updates to existing event definitions. The Illuminate 2.0 Event Definitions Spotlight includes updated event
 definitions for all existing rules.</p>
        <p>Review currently enabled Illuminate event definitions.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apply any customizations to the corresponding updated event, such as notification settings. (Illuminate event
 definitions are provided without any notification settings. If notification settings have been added, or if any
 of the threshold settings have been updated, then these must be applied to the updated event definitions
 included with Illuminate 2.0.0.)</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate back to the “Event Definitions” page in the Graylog web interface.</li>
                    <li>Click on the <em>Edit</em> button on the event definition to be updated.</li>
                    <li>Record any changes to the threshold settings and notifications for the event definition and keep this
 record. (The updated event definitions will have similar titles as the previous definitions but will
 begin with “Illuminate:Events:4;”.)
            </li>
                    <li>Locate and edit the updated event definition.</li>
                    <li>Apply the recorded customizations.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now, enable the new event.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then, disable the old event.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the <em>More</em> button corresponding with the previous event definition.</li>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Remove Previous Event Definition Settings</h2>
        <p>After all event definition settings have been updated, the
 previous revisions of the event definitions should be removed. <strong>It is important to note that once the older
 content pack revisions have been uninstalled, all settings on the event definitions associated with the older
 event definitions will be removed and cannot be recovered.</strong></p>
        <p>To remove the previous event
 definitions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the content pack entry “Graylog Illuminate:Event Definitions;2021-10-16”.</li>
            <li>The available and installed revisions of the content pack will be listed on the left side of the page.</li>
            <li>Click on <em>Uninstall</em> for revisions 1, 2, and 3 <strong>only</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Illuminate Processing Management/versions.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Restore the Processing Order</h2>
        <p>Once the installation is complete, it is necessary to revert to the previous
 processing order.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Configurations</em> in the Graylog web interface.</li>
            <li>Consult your recorded notes on the previous processing order and restore the processing order exactly as
 recorded.
    </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Illuminate 2.0.1</h2>
        <p>For upgrading to Illuminate 2.0.1, you must first install Illuminate 2.0.0 as described
 above. Then, proceed with the following installation and upgrade actions as you did with 2.0.0:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/upgrading_to_illuminate_2.0.x.html#extract-the-graylog-illuminate-release-archive-file">Download
