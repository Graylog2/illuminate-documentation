        <p>A collection of Sigma rules, selected from SOC Prime's Threat Detection Marketplace and curated by the Illuminate team.  These rules are configured to work directly with existing Windows Illuminate content. Once such a content pack is enabled, these rules will appear on the Sigma Rules page where you can select which ones to enable for your environment.  Please review the alerts before enabling them, as there may be performance costs associated with each rule depending on your network. Add other Streams if needed ( e.g. Sysmon and Powershell). Please review the matching Event Definitions to include Notifications, if needed.
