        <p>The Windows Security - Windows Sigma Rules content pack is a collection of <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/sigma_rules.htm">Sigma rules</a> selected from SOC Prime's Threat Detection Marketplace. The rules in this content pack are focused on Windows security threats at a system or environmental level. They are configured to work directly with existing Windows Illuminate content.</p>
        <p>When you enable this content pack, these rules appear on the <i>Sigma Rules</i> page. By default, new rules are disabled. You can select which rules to enable for your environment.</p>
