        <p>The Anomaly Detection Add-on technology pack, and the associated Anomaly Detection spotlight, provide useful components that are required when taking advantage of the <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/anomaly_detection.html">anomaly detection</a> feature in Graylog Security. The Anomaly Detection spotlight provides predefined anomaly detection rules that can be used in conjunction with different Illuminate packs.

        <h3>Anomaly Feature Fields</h3>
        <p>The Anomaly Detection Add-on includes pipelines which will add feature fields used by the anomaly detection rules included in the Anomaly Detection Spotlight. These are usually product-specific fields which indicate a specific type of event has occurred, such as a failed logon, with field names that begin with the prefix anomdet_.</p>
