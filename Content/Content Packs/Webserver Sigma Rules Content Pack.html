        <p>The Webserver Alerting Pack content pack is a collection of <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/sigma_rules.htm">Sigma rules</a>, selected from SOC Prime's Threat Detection Marketplace. The rules in this content pack are focused on webserver threats from end user actions. They are configured to work directly with existing Windows Illuminate content.</p>
        <p>When you enable this content pack, these rules appear on the <i>Sigma Rules</i> page from the <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/security_interface.htm">Security interface</a>. By default, new rules are disabled. You can select which rules to enable for your environment.</p>

                <p>
                    <section class="infoBox">
                        <div class="content"><b>Hint</b>:&#160;To find the Sigma rules added by this content pack, search for <i>Illuminate</i>. All the rules from this pack have titles that begin with <i>Illuminate – Webserver</i>.</div>
                    </section>
                </p>
                <p>To enable an inactive Sigma rule, click the toggle in the Enabled column.</p>
                <p>
                    <section class="infoBox">
                        <div class="content"><b>Hint</b>:&#160;Be sure to review the alerts before enabling them. Each rule can have a performance cost, depending on your network configuration.</div>
                    </section>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update rules if necessary. Some rules can result in many false positives and should be adjusted. Click the rule title to open the edit window where you can review the rule definition and other options. However, note that not all options are editable, including the rule definition.</p>
                <p>If you need to update the rule definition, first clone the rule (select <i>Clone</i> from the <i>More</i> menu). In the cloned rule, you can update any of the fields and options, including the rule definition.</p>
                <p>See <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/sigma_rules.htm">Sigma Rules</a> for complete information about creating and working with Sigma rules.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit and update the event definition, if necessary. Each Sigma rule has a matching event definition, found on the Event Definitions tab of the Alerts page. For Sigma rules you enable, review the matching event definitions. You can add search filters or alerts as well as custom fields.</p>
