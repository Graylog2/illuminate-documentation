        <p>Illuminate is a Graylog-provided collection of content comprising pipelines, parsing rules, lookup tables, and more.
 This content enables various event logs to be processed using a standard methodology, leveraging&#160;the <a href="../Schema/Graylog Information Model Schema/Graylog Information Model Schema.htm">Graylog Information
 Model (GIM) schema</a> to make searching and analyzing common log sources more efficient.</p>
        <p>By enriching and normalizing
 your log data so that the username or IP address is always in the same field, searching for logs becomes much easier
 and faster. Additionally, you can create more universal <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/interacting_with_your_log_data/dashboards.html">dashboards</a> that will work across any data type, as they are mapped to the schema, and regardless of which firewall connection(s) you may have.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, Illuminate works by ingesting logs, sorting them, and processing them. The
 sorting process occurs on the original log message as it comes into Graylog, so <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/getting_in_log_data/getting_in_log_data.html">how the log data is sent</a> affects
 whether Illuminate will pick up and process the message correctly. For example, some devices can send logs in
 multiple formats, like <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/getting_in_log_data/syslog_inputs.html">syslog-compliant messages</a>, BSD-compliant messages, and free-form messages, but a specific form is still required to make parsing rules work. For specifics on system versions, specific formats, or settings, please refer to
 the&#160;individual <a href="../Content Packs/Security Content Packs.html">content pack documentation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Illuminate Architecture</h2>
        <p>Illuminate is designed with a processing hierarchy
 that breaks up processing into two key areas.</p>
        <h3>Content Packs</h3>
        <p>Individual content packs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify logs from the collection of all logs received by a Graylog instance.</li>
            <li>Perform parsing/normalization and apply the Graylog schema.</li>
            <li>Identify specific event message types and assigns type codes.</li>
            <li>Enrich event messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Illuminate Core</h3>
        <p>The Illuminate core processor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides common processing logic to event log messages.</li>
            <li>Identifies common private/reserved IP addresses.</li>
            <li>Enriches event messages that have been assigned event type codes with category, subcategory, and event type
 data.
    </li>
            <li>Optionally provides Geolocation and ASN enrichment to eligible messages using either MaxMind or IPinfo
 databases.
    </li>
            <li>Optionally provides GIM enforcement which will ensure events have required fields for categories and
 subcategories and identifies potential event categorization issues.    </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Performance Impact of Illuminate</h2>
        <p>Illuminate log processing allows for items like <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/interacting_with_your_log_data/alerts.html">alert rules</a>,
    <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/what_more_can_graylog_do_for_me/anomaly_detectors.html">anomaly detectors</a>, and <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/interacting_with_your_log_data/dashboards.html">dashboards</a> to work across
 various log sources. With Illuminate processing log data, you do not have to create separate rules like "Windows
 Logon Brute Force" and "Linux Logon Brute Force." You only need to create one rule to cover them both.</p>
        <p>As with
 all processing in Graylog, there will be performance implications as each log message goes through the process
 described above. Gates or sorting rules are the first set evaluated to limit logs to be processed further,
 shortening the number of rules each message touches.</p>
        <p>Processing rules can range from
    <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/getting_in_log_data/gelf.html">simple key-value extractors</a>, which perform very quickly, to complex regex
 statements or GROK patterns. Each rule can have a different performance impact, and each rule can perform
 differently based on the log type, so finding an actual cost per rule is subjective to an environment.</p>
        <h2>
    Indexes and Shards</h2>
        <p>Graylog Illuminate does not use unique values for
    <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/setting_up_graylog/index_model.html">index and shard settings</a>; instead, it currently takes the
 system's default for those settings. After the indexes and streams are created, you can adjust the default settings
 if a replica is needed or for more or fewer shards.</p>
        <p>Illuminate sets up indexes with a retention time based on
 common practices and standards. These settings allow the dashboards, anomaly rules, and alert rules to have enough
 online data to operate. Adjustments to these settings can be made, but note that any previously saved settings can
 be affected.</p>
